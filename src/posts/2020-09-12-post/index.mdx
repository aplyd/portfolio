*Wait, are blogs still a thing?*

I know what you're thinking, "why start a blog in 2020? do people even still read blogs?", and I hear you.

 I'm personally not a big fan of *reading* blogs (books ftw). But  I was recently inspired by <a href="https://www.swyx.io/">Shawn Wang (aka swyx)</a> and what he calls <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">"learning in public"</a>.

**Here's a few reasons I'm committing to writing about my learning process:**

1. Keep track of the things I'm learning.
2. Write them down to better process and (hopefully) retain the information.
3. Share what I'm learning and working on with the world.
4. Get out of my comfort zone and become a better writer.
5. Keep myself accountable in my pursuit of growth.

<br />

If I end up teaching or helping others along the way, all the better. After all, "the best way to learn is to teach".

**What this blog <u>will</u> be about**

- ideas I'm working on
- ???
- whatever else I feel like writing about

**What this blog <u>won't</u> be about**
- recipes
- design (i'm terrible at it)
- ???
