With its gaining popularity and overly passionate fans, I'd wager it would be more difficult to have *not* heard about TypeScript than to have. Up until this point, I've done everything in my power to avoid learning it (ew Microsoft, amirite) but since I like a challenge, I've decided to use it on my next project. Part of me wanted to know what all of the hype is about and the other part of me figured learning a type safe language would only benefit my as a developer.

For the unfamiliar, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and<a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/'>" extends JavaScript by adding types"</a>.

Even though everything in JavaScript is basically an object, JavaScript still uses types under the hood but doesn't support type safety.

Here are the types that JavaScript supports:
<ul>
    <li>number</li>
    <li>big integer</li>
    <li>string</li>
    <li>boolean</li>
    <li>object</li>
    <li>function</li>
    <li>null</li>
    <li>undefined</li>
</ul>

What does this mean? Well, let's say you have a function that takes two parameters.

```JavaScript
const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b
}
```

Without type safety, JavaScript doesn't care what **types** those values are. You could pass the function `Dog` and `Cat` as strings and it would still attempt to add them together (which would actually work as you'd be concatenating them but it's likely that wasn't your intended result - otherwise you probably would've named the function "concatenate" or something).

*que typescript*

With TS (short for TypeScript), we can guarantee that *only* the correct types will be passed to the function. This "type safety" results in less bugs later down the road and (sometimes) a more pleasant development experience.

```TypeScript
const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
    return a + b
}
```

There are a few different ways to define types but we'll start with the easiest which is inferred types. They're the easiest because you literally don't have to do anything (yay).

### inferred types

```JavaScript
const name = 'Austin'
```

TS is smart enough to know that the above is a string. 

### defined types

```JavaScript
// string
const name: string = 'Austin'

// number
const age: number = 27

// array
const hobbies: string[] = ['coding', 'reading', 'weight lifting']

```

Pretty straight forward, we're defining the data type when defining the variable.

### type interfaces

```TypeScript
interface MyObj {
    name: string,
    age: number
}

const myObj: MyObj = {
    name: 'Austin',
    age: 27
}
```

Fun fact numero dos: when I first started learning JavaScript, I thought "types" and "typing" were somehow related. Types weren't a *super* important aspect of JavaScript so it took me a while to realize "types" referred to "data types" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

PS - Microsoft, if you're reading this, I was kidding about what I said. Please hire me.
