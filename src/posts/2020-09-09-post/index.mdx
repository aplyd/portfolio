I was recently inspired to start this blog by SWYX (https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) and what he calls "learning in public".
Here's a few reasons I'm committing to writing about my learning process:

1. Keep track of the things I'm learning.
2. Write them down to better process and (hopefully) retain the information.
3. Share what I'm learning and working on with the world.
4. Get out of my comfort zone and become a better writer.
5. Keep myself accountable in my pursuit of growth.

If I end up teaching or helping others along the way, all the better. After all, "the best way to learn is to teach".


```javascript
function() {
    return console.log('hello')
    what
}
```

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
