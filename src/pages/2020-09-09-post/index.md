I'm not big into blogging but have decided to start for a few different reasons.

1 ) Keep track of the things I'm learning.
2 ) Write them down to better process and (hopefully) retain the information.
3 ) Share what I'm learning and working on with the world.
4 ) Get out of my comfort zone and become a better writer.
5 ) Keep myself accountable in my pursuit of growth.

I don't expect many readers but I was recently inspired by SWYX (https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) and what he calls "learning in public". We've all learned something only to forget it the next day and I believe the antidote to that is spending a few minutes processing and expanding on the things we've recently learned. If I end up teaching or helping others along the way, all the better. After all, "the best way to learn is to teach"
