TLDR - make a schedule/routine, take notes, set reminders, find something you're passionate about and go with the flow.

i'm super adhd but as i've gotten older, i've learned to embrace it. i used to get frustrated because unless i was really interested in something, i couldn't stay focused. now i kinda just go with the flow. i might start a bunch of different things at once and then jump around slowly completing them. maybe everyone's like this but i wouldn't know because my experience is all ive had - it's like my thoughts aren't naturally linear, they're more like a web of nodes and my attention jumps from one to another one, that may or may not have direct correlation to the previous.

what i've found that helps though is sticking with routines. it's like my mind gets used to doing that specific thing at that time... and even though i'll still catch my mind wondering off to something more interesting, i try to be patient with myself and slowly bring my attention back to whatever it is i'm trying to accomplish. one of the coolest things is we have control over how interesting something is to us. if i find my mind wandering, i try to find something engaging about what i should be doing. when doing less interesting things (cleaning, stretching, etc.), listening to podcasts or audio books are great for keeping the mind busy. 

speaking of routines, this is kinda what mine looks like now:


breakfast
read 1hr
code/work
lunch
code
gym
dinner
clean
stretch
random land

i'm sure most people's schedules look similar. certain times of the day are better for certain tasks. in the morning, i can focus and process more complex ideas better so i try to read and code then. later in the day, the opposite.

setting aside time to just do whatever is interesting at the moment is essential... zero structure... i call it "random land". could be anything from browsing brutalistwebsites.com for design inspiration to binging youtube videos.

oh, and i almost forgot (so meta) my favorite tools are the Reminders app on iOS and pen/paper. ive always wanted the perfect to-do/reminder/planner app but have found those complex tools just get in the way for me. i use the reminders app to... well, set reminders... but also i have folders for "urgent to-do", "grocery list", "wish list", "books to read". any time i randomly think of something i'll need to remember, i embrace my adhd and just jot it down. i use it as a structured notes app basically. and then i always have pen and paper around. if i'm coding, i use it to quickly workout concepts to better understand things. or doodle.

when inspiration speaks, be quick to listen... and write it down. last but not least, and as cliche as it is, find something youre passionate about - it makes focusing and getting into a state of flow much easier. for me, thats code. cheers.
