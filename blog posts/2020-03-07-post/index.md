i don't expect anyone to actually read any of this (i mean, why would you), but if you do, thats cool too. the purpose of this blog is to 1) keep track of the things i'm learning 2) write them down so i can better process them 3) share what i'm learning & working on with the world.

these are my ramblings... mostly code related - but otherwise random. basically like a personal journal but for my dev journey
